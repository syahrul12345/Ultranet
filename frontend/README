To test the frontend with a fast development, the following works well:
* Run ng serve from this directory. It will open a browser but close that for
  now.
  * $ ng server --poll 2000
* Run a backend using one of the scripts in ../backend/scripts/test_nodes. It
  will open a browser pointing at the frontend.
* Change the host in the browser URL opened in the previous step from whatever
  it is by default to localhost:4200.
  * When you do this, you will be loading a dynamically-compiling frontend with
    autoreload BUT your queries will hit the node you just spun up.
